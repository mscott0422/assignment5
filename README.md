How to run code:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run mvn clean
3. Run mvn compile
4. Run mvn package
5. Right click the assignment5.war file --> Run on Server
6. Select your downloaded tomcat server

Note: Make sure to change the default port in your server.xml file to something other than 8080. Then port-forward that port in vs-code and restart your server (if running already).
